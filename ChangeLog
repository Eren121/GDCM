2002-12-6 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * wrapping python correct with standalone wrapped dll (don't use separate
         dll under windows !!!!)
      * removed glib references
      * typedef's inserted in gdcm.i for correct swig type management
      * python21_d MODE DEBUG enabled (ask Frog how to use it)
      * NO problem with having an STL member of class for example string in C++
      * PYTHON TEST OF DCMLIB OK UNDER WINDOWS ON A LARGE SET (one) of IMAGE(s).

2002-11-27 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/demo/*.py load.py extracted from test.py. Added explore.py
        that only displays required tags and testAll.py that parses all
        the files of the testsuite without using unittest.
      * python/testSuite.py other additional test on new files added.
      * Data/* new test files added accordingly to the testSuite.
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx avoid overwriting of the dictionary when
        the vr in the file differs from the one of the dictionary.

2002-11-20 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcm.h and gdcmHeader.cxx gdcm no longer loads all the elements
        values, but limits itself to values which are below a user specified
        size (by default 1024 bytes).
      * python/gdcm.i : elements not loaded (because their size is above the
        user specified treshold) are exported with their TagKey as key of the
        python dictionary. This enables the testsuite to make some checks
        on the unloaded elements (since we have their offset and size).
      * python/testSuite.py
        - now tests for the existence and proper value of the pixel data
        - two new examples added.
      * Data/gdcm-MR-SIEMENS-16.acr[12] added.

2002-11-18 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcm.h and gdcmHeader.cxx are now "Big Endian transfer syntax"
        aware. See the strategy comments in gdcmHeader::FindeLength().
      * Test/test.cxx now accepts a filename as first argument.
      * Data/US-PAL-8-10x-echo.dcm and US-RGB-8-epicard.dcm added.
      * python/testSuite.py changed to integrate test on above files.

2002-11-15 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Dicts/dicomV3.dic removed all the trailing (RET) when the
        the vr was also RET.
      * python/testSuite.py more tests added.

2002-11-14 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/testSuite.py unittest test suite added (uses Data)
      * Data/* dcm and acr files for the test suite.
      * glib dependance removed from un*x version. We now use ISO C99
        7.18 Integer types (see stdint.h)
        - python/Makefile, src/Makefile src/gdcm.h
      * src/ when an explicit vr (like dicom files) suddenly poped an
        implicit element we use to mark the underlying DictEntry of the
        concerned ElValue with "Implicit". This strategy was damageable
        too the public or provite dictionaries, since some of their vr
        would be changed. Since Header::FindLength heavily relies on the
        detection by Header::FindVR of falsely explicit elements, I
        added an extra ImplicitVr member to ElValue (boolean).
        The rest of the changes we the necessary adaptations.

2002-11-12 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader::FindLength bug fix when trapping falsely explicit
        VR files.
      * src/gdcmHeader::FindVR: hard way fix of falsely explicit vr files.

2002-11-8 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Adaptation for porting to VC++:
        - src/gdcm.h
          o forced to use std namespace (for string to be known)
          o all class use __declspec export style on WIN32
        - src/gdcmUtil.cxx new Exit method that wraps the exit call
          (in stdlib.h on Win32 but in std:: for gcc)
      * src/gdcmDictSet::SetDictPath adds a trailing / to environement
        variable GDCM_DICT_PATH.
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx verbose comments made discrete.

2002-11-7 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * python/gdcm.i: added a typemap that converts a C++ hashing table
        to native Python dictionary.
      * python/demo/test.py:
        - now uses the native dictionary for exploration of gdcmHeader.
        - takes an optional filename argument (the file to parse).
      * src/gdcm.h and gdcmHeader.cxx: gdcmHeader now has an accessor on
        PubElVals hashing table. 
      * Dicts/dicomV3.dic removed error prone trailing spaces.

2002-11-6 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Python wrapping process moved away from src/Makefile to
        newly created python/Makefile (as well as gdcm.i)
      * python/demo/test.py (that mirrors Test/test.cxx) is effective.
      * src/gdcmHeader::FindLength only looks for current vr when necessary.
      * src/gdcmDictSet.cxx: the dictionnaries directory path is now imported
        from the environement variable GDCM_DICT_PATH (when existing).
      * src/gdcmDict::GetTag bug fix.

2002-10-31 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Straightforward temporary fixes for swig to build the python wrappers.
        src/Makefile now has a python working entry [by working we mean
        that we can import de shadow classes without errors].

2002-10-29 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * hashtest.cxx removed (since allready in Test)
      * src/gdcmlib.h renamed to src/gdcm.h
      * src/dcm.i renamed to src/gdcm.i
      * src/Makefile prepared for python wrapping

2002-10-29 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx :
        - Parsing of header is now separated from loading of element values
          (see gdcmHeader::LoadElements).
        - general clean up of hopefully all file access (creation of
          ReadInt16 and ReadInt32)

2002-10-22 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx :
        - RecupLgr renamed to FindLength and cut off with new IsAnInteger
          method.
        - SetLgrElem renamed to SetLength
        - GetLgrElem renamed to GetLength
        - ~gdcmHeader() made virtual to pesky warning messages at compile.
      * src/gdcmElValSet.cxx fixed both GetElValue methods
      * Dicts/dicomV3.dic falacious entry [7fe0 0010 OT PXL Pixel Data]
        due to IdoDude was cleaned out.

2002-10-21 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx RecupLgr split in FindVR and RecupLgr. FindVR
        concentrates on finding the value representation (when it exists).
        RecupLgr now only finds the element value length, and it avoids
        returning the unecessary skL (skipped length).
        Also, offsetCourant was simply removed (with taille_fich) since
        it was redundant with the File position internals (by using
        ftell and fseek). This also made skL (see above in RecupLgr) usage
        jajun.
      * src/gdcmHeaderIdo.cxx src/gdcmIdo.h added. Those files concentrate
        on the libido specificities which are handled through class 
        inheritance.
      * Test/implicit_vr.dcm dicom v3 in implicit value representation
        added. 

2002-10-17 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * Truckload of changes. Parsing of header is barely functional
        (see Test/test) with the standard dictionary (see Dicts/dicomV3.dic).

2002-10-10 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader.cxx many addons of low level methods

2002-10-07 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * src/gdcmHeader now contains_IdDcmCheckSwap, _IdDcmRecupLgr,
        and _IdDcmSWAP_LONG.

2002-09-12 Eric Boix <Eric.Boix@creatis.insa-lyon.fr>
      * This corresponds to all the changes decided at the meeting of
        May 23 2002. Needless to say we are running late...
