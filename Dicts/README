Sources for dicom public dictionaries:
 * the official source is the part 6 of the dicom standard (see
   http://www.dclunie.com/dicom-status/status.html#BaseStandard2001).
 * http://www.fpimage.com/Manuals/Imp/dicomdic.html
   an html group based presentation.
 * ftp://rsbweb.nih.gov/pub/nih-image/documents/dicom-dict.txt
   a C syntax oriented version provided by NIH (Jim Nash)
 * http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/AFNI_Dist/afni_src.tgz
   extract mri_dicom_hdr.c (tar zxvf afni_src.tgz afni_src/mri_dicom_hdr.c)
   and look for the definitions of CMD_dictionary, META_dictionary,
   ID_dictionary, PAT_dictionary...
 * Actually, the *official* Dicom Data Dictionary 
   is on http://medical.nema.org/dicom/2003/03_06PU.pdf
   (check it every year, some tags are added, some names change)
   All C syntax oriented stuff, or anything else -but gdcm one-
   you can find on the net is very partial.
   WARNING : The Dicom Tag is an identifier inside the Dicom Dictionary,
             The Tag Name *is not*


Comment on the file NIH.dic, you can find the following discussion
on comp.protocol.dicom(*). As clearly specify by David Clunie all
thoses tags are extremely dangerous to use since they override some
other, we are only adding them to gdcm to be able to read /apparently/
some NIH images. SHOULD NOT EVER BE USED FOR WRITTING IMAGES !

I suspect these were taken for the draft for trial implementation
of Sup 23 SR, which was problematic in many ways, not the least
of which was that some of its attributes with the same number
were re-used with different purpose and VR, etc.

Some may have been from early drafts of other supplements (e.g.,
waveform from the looks of things).

None of these should ever be used.
