<UL>
   <LI> <b>PrintFile</b>
   <pre>
   Displays the header of any kind of ACR-NEMA/PAPYRUS/DICOM File
   usage: PrintFile filein=fileName [level=n] 
                    [ { [noshadowseq] | [noshadow][noseq] } ] [debug] [usage]
          level = 0,1,2 : depending on the amount of details user wants to see
          noshadowseq: user doesn't want to load Private Sequences
          noshadow   : user doesn't want to load Private groups (odd number)
          noseq      : user doesn't want to load Sequences
          debug      : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
          usage      : user wants to display usage
   </pre>

   <LI> <b>Anonymize</b>
   <pre>
   Anonymizes a full gdcm-readable Dicom image
          Warning : probably segfaults if pixels are not gdcm readable.
                    Use AnonymizeNoLoad instead.
   usage: Anonymize filein=inputFileName fileout=anonymizedFileName [debug][usage]
          debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
          usage    : user wants to display usage
  </pre>

   <LI> <b>AnonymizeNoLoad</b>
   <pre> 
   Anonymizes a gdcm-readable Dicom image even if pixels aren't gdcm readable
         Warning : Warning : the image is overwritten;
                   to preserve its integrity, use a copy.
   usage: AnonymizeNoLoad {filein=inputFileName|dirin=inputDirectoryName}
                          [rubout=listOfPrivateElementsToRubOut]

          inputFileName : Name of the (single) file user wants to anonymize
          inputDirectoryName : user wants to anonymize *all* the files
                               within the (single Patient!) directory

   <LI> <b>ReWrite</b>
   <pre>
   Re writes a full gdcm-readable Dicom image (compressed Pixels are expanded)
                   (usefull when the file is not very straight).

   <LI> <b>PrintDicomDir</b>
   <pre>
   Displays the tree-like structure of a DICOMDIR File
   usage: PrintDicomDir filein=fileName [detail=n] [level=n] [debug] [usage]
          detail = 1 : Patients, 2 : Studies, 3 : Series, 4 : Images
                   5 : Full Content

   </pre>

   <LI> <b>MakeDicomDir</b>
   <pre>
