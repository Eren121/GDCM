<H2>Command Line Utilities :</H2>
<UL>
   <LI> PrintFile
   <pre>
   Display the header of any kind of ACR-NEMA/PAPYRUS/DICOM File
   usage: PrintFile filein=fileName [level=n] [noshadow] [noseq] [debug]
          level = 0,1,2 : depending on the amount of details user wants to see
          noshadow : user doesn't want to load Private groups (odd number)
          noseq    : user doesn't want to load Sequences
          debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
   </pre>

   <LI> Anonymize
   <pre>
   Anonymize a full gdcm-readable Dicom image
          Warning : probably segfaults if pixels are not gdcm readable.
                    Use AnonymizeNoLoad instead.
   usage: Anonymize filein=inputFileName fileout=anonymizedFileName [debug]
          debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
   </pre>

   <LI> AnonymizeNoLoad
   <pre> 
   Anonymize a gdcm-readable Dicom image even if pixels aren't gdcm readable
          Warning : the file is overwritten; to preserve file integrity,
                    use a copy.
   usage: AnonymizeNoLoad filein=inputFileName fileout=outputFileName [debug]
          debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
   </pre>

   <LI> ReWrite
   <pre>
   Re write a full gdcm-readable Dicom image (compressed Pixels are expanded)
                   (usefull when the file is not very straight).                  
   usage: ReWrite filein=inputFileName fileout=anonymizedFileName
                   [mode=write mode] [noshadow] [noseq][debug]
          mode = a (ACR), x (Explicit VR Dicom), r (RAW : only pixels)
          noshadow : user doesn't want to load Private groups (odd number)
          noseq    : user doesn't want to load Sequences
          rgb      : user wants to transform LUT (if any) into RGB 
          debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode' 
   </pre>

   <LI> PrintDicomDir
   <pre>
   Display the tree-like structure of a DICOMDIR File
   usage: PrintDicomDir filein=fileName [detail=n] [level=n] [debug]
          detail = 1 : Patients, 2 : Studies, 3 : Series, 4 : Images
                   5 : Full Content
          level = 0,1,2 : depending on user (what he wants to see, when detail=5)
           debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
   </pre>

   <LI> MakeDicomDir
   <pre>
   Explores recursively the given directory, makes the relevant DICOMDIR
          and writes it as 'NewDICOMDIR'
   usage: MakeDicomDir dirname=rootDirectoryName [noshadow] [noseq] [debug]
          noshadow : user doesn't want to load Private groups (odd number)
          noseq    : user doesn't want to load Sequences
          debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
   </pre>

   <LI> AnonymizeDicomDir
   <pre>
   Anonymize a gdcm-readable DICOMDIR even when some 'Objects'
          are not yet taken into account
          Warning : the DICOMDIR is overwritten
   usage: AnonymizeDicomDir filein=dicomDirName [debug]
          debug    : user wants to run the program in 'debug mode'
   </pre>
