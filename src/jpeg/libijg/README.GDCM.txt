This directory contains a subset of the Independent JPEG Group's (IJG)
libjpeg version 6b.  We only include enough of distribution to build
libjpeg.  We do not include the standard executables that come with
libjpeg (cjpeg, djpeg, etc.). Furthermore, the standard libjpeg build
process is replaced with a CMake build process.

We'd like to thank the IJG for distributing a public JPEG IO library.

Modifications
-------------

1.
jconfig.h is usually generated by the build process. For this distribution,
we ship a version of jconfig.h.in to be used across several platforms. It's 
purpose is also to allow generation of both 8bits and 12bits lib.



2.
jdhuff.c was modified to support special Philips MRI image:

jmorecfg.h was modified so that we can modify it automatically at build time to
either generate a 8bits jpeg lib or 12bits jpeg library:

4.
To further allow us to have to different copy of the 8bits and 12bits jpeg
library we had to mangle the name. Fur this purpose two new file were added to
the library: gdcm_mangle_8bits.h and gdcm_mangle_12bits.h. Those file were
generated using:

        nm libgdcmijpeg8.a | grep " T " | colrm 1 11 | sort


5.
In order to read lossless images, we had to apply the ls-patch to jpeg-6b ... to be continued


(shoud we disalbe getenv just as dcmtk ?
