/*
DICOM provides a mechanism for supporting the use of JPEG Image Compression 
through the Encapsulated Format (see PS 3.3 of the DICOM Standard). 
Annex A defines a number of Transfer Syntaxes which reference 
the JPEG Standard and provide a number of lossless (bit preserving) 
and lossy compression schemes.
In order to facilitate interoperability of implementations conforming 
to the DICOM Standard which elect to use one or more 
of the Transfer Syntaxes for JPEG Image Compression, the following policy is specified:

  Any implementation which conforms to the DICOM Standard and has elected 
  to support any one of the Transfer Syntaxes for lossless JPEG Image Compression, 
  shall support the following lossless compression: 
  The subset (first-order horizontal prediction [Selection Value 1) of JPEG Process 14 
  (DPCM, non-hierarchical with Huffman coding) (see Annex F of the DICOM Standard).

   Any implementation which conforms to the DICOM Standard and has elected 
   to support any one of the Transfer Syntaxes for 8-bit lossy JPEG Image Compression, 
   shall support the JPEG Baseline Compression (coding Process 1).

   Any implementation which conforms to the DICOM Standard and has elected 
   to support any one of the Transfer Syntaxes for 12-bit lossy JPEG Image Compression, 
   shall support the JPEG Compression Process 4.

Note: The DICOM conformance statement shall differentiate between implementations 
that can simply receive JPEG encoded images and those that can receive and process 
JPEG encoded images (see PS 3.2 of the DICOM Standard).

The use of the DICOM Encapsulated Format to support JPEG Compressed Pixel Data 
implies that the Data Elements which are related to the Native Format Pixel Data encoding
(e.g. Bits Allocated, Bits Stored, High Bit, Pixel Representation, Rows, Columns, etc.) 
shall contain values which are consistent with the characteristics 
of the uncompressed pixel data from which the compressed Data Stream was derived. 
The Pixel Data characteristics included in the JPEG Interchange Format 
shall be used to decode the compressed data stream.

Run Length Encoding Compression

DICOM provides a mechanism for supporting the use of Run Length Encoding (RLE) 
Compression which is a byte oriented lossless compression scheme through 
the encapsulated Format (see PS 3.3 of this Standard). 
Annex G of the DICOM Standard defines RLE Compression and its Transfer Syntax.

Note: The RLE Compression algorithm described in Annex G 
of the DICOM Standard is the compression used in 
the TIFF 6.0 specification known as the "PackBits" scheme.

The use of the DICOM Encapsulated Format to support RLE Compressed Pixel Data 
implies that the Data Elements which are related to the Native Format Pixel Data encoding (
e.g. Bits Allocated, Bits Stored, High Bit, Pixel Representation, Rows, Columns, etc.) 
shall contain values which are consistent with the characteristics 
of the uncompressed pixel data from which the compressed data is derived

/*
 * SOME FINE POINTS:
 *
 * In the above loop, we ignored the return value of jpeg_write_scanlines,

 * with this because we were only relying on the value of cinfo.next_scanline,
 * which will be incremented correctly.  If you maintain additional loop
 * variables then you should be careful to increment them properly.
 * Actually, for output to a stdio stream you needn't worry, because
 * then jpeg_write_scanlines will write all the lines passed (or else exit
 * with a fatal error).  Partial writes can only occur if you use a data
 * destination module that can demand suspension of the compressor.
 * (If you don't know what that's for, you don't need it.)
 *
 * If the compressor requires full-image buffers (for entropy-coding
 * optimization or a multi-scan JPEG file), it will create temporary
 * files for anything that doesn't fit within the maximum-memory setting.
 * (Note that temp files are NOT needed if you use the default parameters.)
 * On some systems you may need to set up a signal handler to ensure that
 * temporary files are deleted if the program is interrupted.  See libjpeg.doc.
 *
 * Scanlines MUST be supplied in top-to-bottom order if you want your JPEG
 * files to be compatible with everyone else's.  If you cannot readily read
 * your data in that order, you'll need an intermediate array to hold the
 * image.  See rdtarga.c or rdbmp.c for examples of handling bottom-to-top
 * source data using the JPEG code's internal virtual-array mechanisms.

/******************** JPEG DECOMPRESSION SAMPLE INTERFACE *******************/

/* This half of the example shows how to read data from the JPEG decompressor.
 * It's a bit more refined than the above, in that we show:
 *   (a) how to modify the JPEG library's standard error-reporting behavior;
 *   (b) how to allocate workspace using the library's memory manager.
 *
 * Just to make this example a little different from the first one, we'll
 * assume that we do not intend to put the whole image into an in-memory
 * buffer, but to send it line-by-line someplace else.  We need a one-
 * scanline-high JSAMPLE array as a work buffer, and we will let the JPEG
 * memory manager allocate it for us.  This approach is actually quite useful
 * because we don't need to remember to deallocate the buffer separately: it
 * will go away automatically when the JPEG object is cleaned up.
 */

/*
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 *
 * The JPEG library's standard error handler (jerror.c) is divided into
 * several "methods" which you can override individually.  This lets you
 * adjust the behavior without duplicating a lot of code, which you might
 * have to update with each future release.
 *
 * Our example here shows how to override the "error_exit" method so that
 * control is returned to the library's caller when a fatal error occurs,
 * rather than calling exit() as the standard error_exit method does.
 *
 * We use C's setjmp/longjmp facility to return control.  This means that the
 * routine which calls the JPEG library must first execute a setjmp() call to
 * establish the return point.  We want the replacement error_exit to do a
 * longjmp().  But we need to make the setjmp buffer accessible to the
 * error_exit routine.  To do this, we make a private extension of the
 * standard JPEG error handler object.  (If we were using C++, we'd say we
 * were making a subclass of the regular error handler.)
 *
 * Here's the extended error handler struct:
 */

 * \brief   routine for JPEG decompression from a memory buffer.
 * routine for JPEG decompression from a memory buffer. This routine
 * only reads one JPEG image at a time, but returns information about
 * how many bytes have been consumed from the \c input_buffer, and 
 * how many bytes have been written into the output \c image_buffer.
 *
 * @param input_buffer pointer to a memory buffer containing the jpeg
 *                     compressed data.
 * @param buflen length of the memory buffer.
 * @param image_buffer pointer to the location where the decompressed
 *                     image will be filled.
 * @param howManyRead returns how many bytes have been consumed from the
 *                    input_buffer.
 * @param howManyWritten returns how many bytes have been written into
 *                       the output image_buffer.
 * @return 1 on success, 0 on error
