* For compiling the library and C++ test programs:

./configure
make
make install

You can use the --prefix option of the configure script to force installation
in some place (default is /usr/local/DCMlib):

./configure --prefix=/where/ever/you/want


* For testing in C++:
./Test/test ../Data/CR-MONO1-10-chest.dcm (or any other file in there)


* For testing in Python:
cd python/gdcmPython
make  (requires SWIG Version 1.3.16u i.e. the contemporary devel version)
python testSuite.py (test suite written in unittest, you should use python2)


* For manual test in python:
cd python/demo
python test.py ../../Data/CR-MONO1-10-chest.dcm (or any other file)
